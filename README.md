Diabetes Prediction :
This project focuses on predicting the likelihood of diabetes in individuals using machine learning techniques. Diabetes is a chronic condition that affects millions worldwide, posing significant health risks if left untreated.

Dataset :
The dataset utilized in this project is sourced from a comprehensive diabetes prediction dataset. It encompasses various attributes such as age, gender, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c level, and blood glucose level. The dataset has undergone preprocessing to handle missing values and categorical variables.

Methodologies Used :
  1) Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, removing duplicates, filling null values, and addressing skewness.
  2) Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) + Feature Engineering: Visualizing relationships between different features and the presence of diabetes.
  3) Model Training: Utilizing Logistic Regression for model training and validation purposes.
  4) Model Evaluation: Employing evaluation metrics such as confusion matrix and accuracy score.
  5) Result : The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of 95.7% on the test set, surpassing alternative models under consideration. For the train data it achieved an accuracy of 97%.
